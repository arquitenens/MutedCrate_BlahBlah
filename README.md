I have no idea how to use git sorry
anyways its kinda rope like structure.. or a fragmented array i guess
Anyways its purpose is to do extremely cheap copies of any amount of data structures which then get treated a contigious vector which is indexable
the "Primitive" version is quite a bit faster in creating/converting to the required data structure but is limite to the primitive types.. primitive types is a bit broad it really means just integers
but if you just happen to have an integer vector? well your in good luck! just use the primitive version.. i guess? i hope its not the most unsafe thing ever.. the normal version should be rather safe though
